# Brain-Tumour-Detection
In this Project we experimented with various pretrained Convolutional Neural Network based models like VGG-16, RESNET , MobileNet for training a model for brain tumour detection.
Brain tumour is generally classified into 3 categories namely Glioma, Meningioma and Pituitary. 
The model is trained over a dataset consisting of 5712 MRI scan images further divided into categories of Healthy, Glioma, Meningioma and Pituitary.
We finally selected Mobile Net with a final accuracy of 0.9
